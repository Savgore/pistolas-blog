<!-- AUTHOR: Replace or delete this placeholder post before going live -->

This is a placeholder post to confirm the site builds correctly and that the tag system, RSS feeds, and post template are all working as expected.

When you're ready to publish, delete this file and start adding your own posts to the `posts/` directory. Each post is a Markdown file with the frontmatter format described in `HANDOFF.md`.

The tag system is fully automatic — any tag you add to a post's frontmatter will appear in the tag bar, get its own archive page at `/tag/[tag]/`, and generate its own RSS feed at `/feeds/tags/[tag]/feed.xml`. No configuration changes needed.
